     *  Stretch Goal

        If you have extra time in the session, or wish to experiment further, create a `Bank` class to manage accounts. Consider the following ideas â€” you may choose to implement some, all or come up with your own:
        - storing a internal list of accounts. Remember that accounts in the list could be instances of the `Account` class, the `SavingsAccount` class, or the `CurrentAccount` class.
        - opening a new account, given a type and balance.
        - getting a list of account numbers held by the bank
        - getting an account, given an account number
        - closing an account, given an account number
        - displaying a report of all accounts held by the bank
        - paying a dividend to all accounts held by the bank
        - applying interest to all savings accounts
        - contacting all current account holders if their account is in overdraft.
